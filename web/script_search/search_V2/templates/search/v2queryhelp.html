<h1>Search Query Help</h1>
<div>
  The Norman Lear Center Script Database site allows for the use of standard boolean logic such as AND (&), OR (|), and
  NOT (!).
  <br />
  <br />
  To find scripts containing variations of the word "donation" but not variations of "politics" nor "organ":
  <br />
  donation & !politics & !organ
  <br />
  <br />
  Parentheses can be used to group items together. E.g., if one word is required and one other word within a group is
  required:
  <br />
  drive & (blood | food)
  <br />
  <br />
  A special operator "<->" creates searches for words appearing next to each other:
    <br />
    blood<->drive | food<->drive
        <br />
        <br />
        The "appearing next to" operator can be slightly modified to find words n spots from each other:
        <br />
        habitat<2>humanity | make<3>foundation
</div>
